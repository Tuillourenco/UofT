## Plotly & Belly Button Biodiversity Project.

The sponsor is a biological researcher who works for a vital microbiology laboratory, interested in publishing studies about bacteria species that can synthesize proteins that taste like beef. The research starts from the principle that those bacteria can be found in human beings' belly buttons. To prove that theory, the researcher has sampled the navel of some volunteer people across the country to identify bacterial species that live in their belly buttons. Gathering the results, the project's goal needs to build an interactive dashboard that volunteers and researchers can access.

To achieve the deliverables, the project team will use Plotly, the JavaScript data visualization library, and other tools to create the required dashboard. Its purpose is to demonstrate where volunteers can identify the top 10 bacterial species that live in their belly buttons. In summary, besides the dashboard release, the project deliverables targets are to make available the sample data identifying the top ten bacterial species collected in the samples, this way to point to the potential bacteria candidate that could synthesize beef taste.

# Credit Risk Analysis Project.
## Project Description.
The project's sponsor commends the team for all your hard work so far; piece by piece, they have built up their data preparation skills, statistical reasoning, and machine learning. Now, it's time to apply machine learning to solve a real-world challenge: credit card risk.
Credit risk is an unbalanced classification problem, as good loans easily outnumber risky loans. Therefore, different techniques are needed to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes. The stakeholders expect the project manager to use imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries to build and evaluate models using resampling.

## Project Scope.
Using the credit card credit dataset from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company, the analysts will oversample the data using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms and undersample the data using the ClusterCentroids algorithm. Then, a combinatorial approach of over- and undersampling will be conducted using the SMOTEENN algorithm. 
Furthermore, to predict credit risk, it's necessary to compare two new machine learning models that reduce bias, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier. Once done, it will be evaluated the performance of these models and make a written recommendation on whether they should be used to predict credit risk.

## Project Deliverables.
This new project consists of three technical analysis deliverables and a written report describing the outcomes. As documents, the project team will submit the following:
- Deliverable 1: Use Resampling Models to Predict Credit Risk
- Deliverable 2: Use the SMOTEENN Algorithm to Predict Credit Risk
- Deliverable 3: Use Ensemble Classifiers to Predict Credit Risk
- Deliverable 4: A Written Report on the Credit Risk Analysis (README.md)

## Supervised Machine Learning and Credit Risk Project

### Project Description.
In this module, the project team will use Python to build and evaluate several machine-learning models to predict credit risk. Predicting credit risk with machine learning algorithms can help banks and financial institutions predict anomalies, reduce risk cases, monitor portfolios, and provide recommendations on what to do in cases of fraud.
More than 19 million US citizens have had at least one unsecured personal loan in recent years. That's a record-breaking number! Private lending is growing faster than credit cards, auto, mortgages, and even student debt. FinTech firms are storming ahead of traditional loan processes with such incredible growth. Using the latest machine learning techniques, these FinTech firms can continuously analyze large amounts of data and predict trends to optimize lending.

### Project Scope.
In this project, some techniques will be required for the team, as demonstrated below : 
- Explain how a machine learning algorithm is used in data analytics.
Create training and test groups from a given data set.
- Implement the logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, and support vector machine algorithms.
- Interpret the logistic regression results, decision tree, random forest, and support vector machine algorithms.
- Compare the advantages and disadvantages of each supervised learning algorithm.
- Determine which supervised learning algorithm is best for a given data set or scenario.
- Use ensemble and resampling techniques to improve model performance.

## Looking Ahead
### In this repo, I've been introduced to the open-source distribution software called Anaconda and one of its products, Jupyter Notebook. This software allows you to create documents that contain live code using Python. Jupyter Notebook supports over 40 different programming languages, but in this module, you'll use Python as you learn the basics of the Pandas library. Pandas is an open-source library that provides high-performance data analysis tools. Using Jupyter Notebook and the Pandas library, I read raw data from CSV files, inspected and clean data, merged datasets, performed mathematical calculations, and visualized the data with charts and graphs to tell a story.

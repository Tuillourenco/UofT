## Project Description.
The stakeholders are convinced that unsupervised learning is the best way forward for the dataset because the team is looking for any groupings, trends, or other information that could help the company pitch cryptocurrencies.

For example, if it's wanted to build a model that, when given unfamiliar data, can accurately predict the results.

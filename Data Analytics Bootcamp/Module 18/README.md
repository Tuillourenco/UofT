## Unsupervised Machine Learning and Cryptocurrencies
In this repo, the team will dive deeper into machine learning using unsupervised algorithms, which help us explore data when it's not sure what is looking for, further, the analysts can analyze data without a clear output in mind.
The team will work primarily with the K-means algorithm, the main unsupervised algorithm that groups similar data into clusters. Once done, it builds on this by speeding up the process using principal component analysis (PCA), which employs many different features.

### As the scope of this project, the team will work on the following: 

- Describe the differences between supervised and unsupervised learning, including real-world examples.
- Preprocess data for unsupervised learning.
- Cluster data using the K-means algorithm.
- Determine the best number of centroids for K-means using the elbow curve.
- Use PCA to limit features and speed up the model.

# Pewlett Hackard Project Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:
### In this project, the main sponsor of Pewlett Hackard wants to foresee the impact of retiring employees on the company, so open hiring to avoid the effects on the staff and productivity. To get the expected results, the Postgres database and pgAdmin four interfaces were used to ask data queries and find relationships between different data tables using Structured Query Language (SQL).

## Results:
### When it started coding, the team faced some early results realizing that the employees who are eligible to retire generally started as assistant engineers, engineers, or staff members and climbed the hierarchy to higher positions. Afterwards, in consequence of the first approach, departing employees with senior titles such as Senior Engineer or Senior Staff composed most of the retiring collaborators, according to the retiring titles table (63.7% ).

### There are more findings, a significant number of individuals who are qualified for mentoring programmes work as engineers or senior employees, which may strongly impact the company's policy on training and passing knowledge to the next generations. In counterpart, the less amount of them is from the management department, what it's a reasonable conjecture when analyzing the enterprise's strategies and projects inserted in the portfolio.

## Summary:
### In summary, of course, at a glance, there were some concerns that the company would lose its valuable collaborators who were part of its history. However,  in that scenario, there was an opportunity as well; before the "silver tsunami" began to make an impact, there would be 90389 spaces to be replaced. In addition, information on the retiring_titles table provided helpful insights into what percentage of roles should be fulfilled.

### Another question was whether there'd be enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in each department for mentoring the next generation; the mentorship_eligibilty table answered this. There are enough experienced individuals for every department to be used as mentors for the upcoming young employees of Pewlett Hackard.

### The project's outcome has shown the main stakeholders the importance of using information retained on the tables and manipulating them to foresee possible scenarios that may impact the company's future. While collaborators are retiring who could be mentors, the findings encountered plenty of employees who can help mentor the newcomers and use the lessons learned from previous projects, keeping the company's intel.

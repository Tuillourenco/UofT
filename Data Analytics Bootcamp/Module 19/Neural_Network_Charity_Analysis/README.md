## Neural Network Charity Analysis Project.
### Project Description.
The team project had come a long way since her first day at that boot camp five years ago and earlier this week when they started learning about neural networks! Now, they are finally ready to put their skills to work to help the foundation predict where to invest. With their knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, they’ll use the features in the provided dataset to help the team create a binary classifier capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

From Alphabet Soup’s business team, the analysts received a CSV containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. Within this dataset are several columns that capture metadata about each organization, such as the following:
- EIN and NAME—Identification columns
- APPLICATION_TYPE—Alphabet Soup application type
- AFFILIATION—Affiliated sector of industry
- CLASSIFICATION—Government organization classification
- USE_CASE—Use case for funding
- ORGANIZATION—Organization type
- STATUS—Active status
- INCOME_AMT—Income classification
- SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS—Special consideration for application
- ASK_AMT—Funding amount requested
- IS_SUCCESSFUL—Was the money used effectively

### Project Deliverables.
This project consists of three technical analysis deliverables and a written report. It has as outputs the following:
- Deliverable 1: Preprocessing Data for a Neural Network Model
- Deliverable 2: Compile, Train, and Evaluate the Model
- Deliverable 3: Optimize the Model
- Deliverable 4: A Written Report on the Neural Network Model (README.md)

## Neural Networks and Deep Learning Models.

In this project, the team will explore and implement neural networks using the TensorFlow platform in Python. It'll be discussed the background and history of computational neurons as well as current implementations of neural networks as they apply to deep learning. 
At the same time, the team will analyze the high costs and benefits of different neural networks and compare these costs to traditional machine learning classification and regression models. Additionally, it'll put into practice implementing neural networks and deep neural networks across several different datasets, including image, natural language, and numerical datasets. 
Finally, it'll be demonstrated how to store and retrieve trained models for more robust uses.

## Extract, Transform, Load.

### In this module, the project had as scope to use the Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) process to create data pipelines. A data pipeline moves data from a source to a destination, and the ETL process begins pipelines that also transform the data along the way. The analysis is impossible without access to good data, so creating data pipelines is often the first step before any analysis can be performed. Therefore, understanding ETL is an essential skill for data analysis.
